#### Breaking Changes
- US969005: The `db.pass` argument has been replaced by `db.secret`.  
  - This program now expects to be passed the key of a secret rather than the value of a secret.
  - For example, pass `db.secret CAF_STORAGE_DATABASE_PASSWORD` instead of `db.pass P@ssw0rd`. The program will then look up the actual
    secret using the key.
  - This change prevents secrets being exposed when calling this program.
