#### Version Number
${version-number}

#### Breaking Changes
- US969005: The `db.pass` argument has been replaced by `db.secret`.  
  - This program now expects to be passed the name/key of a secret/password, rather than the actual secret/password.
  - For example, pass `db.secret CAF_STORAGE_DATABASE_PASSWORD` instead of `db.pass P@ssw0rd`. The program will then look up the actual
    secret/password using the name/key.
  - This change prevents passwords being exposed when calling this program.
